      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	  <h3> Introduction </h3>
	  <p> Garcon ("Garcon") is the provider of services called Garcon (the "Service"), accessible at http://garcon.app. Garcon seeks to respect your privacy. This policy describes the information we collect during your use of the Service and how we use it.</p>
	  <h3> Collected Information Provided By The User </h3>
	  <p> Garcon requires several pieces of personal information in order to operate as designed. Name and Venmo account information are required to use any Garcon Service. We may, however, request other information, which may be required for certain Services.</p>
	  <h3> Additional Collected Information </h3>
	  <p> Garcon will also collect non-personally identifiable information as part of the service. This will typically include browser type, language preference, IP address, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Garcon collects this data to optimize our service to users.</p>
	  <p> Additionally, Garcon collects information from its mobile phone users in a similar manner to optimize the mobile experience. Beyond mobile phone numbers, we collect mobile screen resolution, device make and manufacturer, as well as the device's unique identifier.</p>
	  <h3> Use And Disclosure of Collected Information </h3>
	  <p> Except as set forth in this policy, Garcon uses provided and collected information only for internal purposes and does not disclose data to third parties. Garcon may occasionally inform users of new releases and features via any communication methods you have provided to the Service.</p>
	  <p> Transfers: Garcon may share data internally with its affiliate companies and may disclose certain information in the event that it is merged, acquired, sold, or some of its assets are acquired. If, in Garcon's discretion, your information will be handled in a materially different manner after such a transaction than it was by Garcon, you may have the opportunity to opt-out of having your information shared with any acquirer.</p>
	  <p> Other: Garcon may disclose data to respond to valid legal process from competent authorities, meet legal requirements, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, protect Garcon's interests, fight against fraud, and to enforce our policies or to protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.</p>
	  <h3> Jurisdiction</h3>
	  <p> All information passed through Garcon is primarily handled in the United States but may from time to time be handled in any country in which Garcon or its affiliate companies maintain facilities. By using the Service, you agree that the handling of your personal information and any communication through the Service will be governed by the laws of the United States and any applicable state laws.</p>
