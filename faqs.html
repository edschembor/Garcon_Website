      <h1>FAQs</h1>
	  <h3> What is Garcon? </h3>
	  <p> Garcon is an application currently in development for Android and web platforms. The app allows users to create "tasks" with prices and deadlines which other users can then complete in return for the task price. Garcon essentially allows for users to have personal "butlers" when needed and allows others to make money as a "deliverer" without having to be employed by a single organization. </p>
	  <h3> When is Garcon expected to be fully released? </h3>
	  <p> Android: May 2015 | Web: June 2015</p>
	  <h3> How can I beta-test Garcon </h3>
	  <p> See our "Contact" page. </p>
	  <h3> How are the financial transactions facilitated </h3>
	  <p> We make use of Venmo and their API to make sure all transactions are safe </p>
	  <h3> Is a Venmo account necessary for using Garcon? </h3>
	  <p> Yes. See above. </p>
	  <h3> How does the payment system work?</h3>
	  <p> When a user creates a task, the price of the task is taken from their Venmo account and placed in a temporary holding place. If the user has insufficient funds, the task will not be created. Then, after a task is completed and both users have signaled that completion has occured, the money is moved from the temporary bin to the account of the user who completed the task.</p>
	  <h3> What if I complete a task and the person who created it doesn't say I completed it? </h3>
	  <p> First, a user will never be able to create a task if they have insufficient funds. Second, the rating system prevent bad users (see below). Our chat system allows users to make sure they are on the same page regarding the details of the task and its completion. If issues are still had, contact our support team who will work to resolve them. </p>
	  <h3> How does the rating system work? </h3>
	  <p> Each user has a rating for creating tasks and a rating for completing tasks. After a task is completed, the two users rate each other. If a users rating for either falls below 4, the user's account is suspended. If a users rating for either falls below 3, the user's account is banned.</p>
