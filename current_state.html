      <h1>1/4/15 - Current State of Development</h1>
	  <p> Why did we decide to develop Garcon? After throwing ideas around and thinking about issues that typical college students have, we thought that Garcon was perfect: it allowed for (1) students who are busy doing research/homework to get food delivered and (2) broke college kids to make some spending money without having to have an official, scheduled job.</p>
	  <p>  After a long semester of development, we are quite proud with the current state of Garcon. Currently, we have the main use cases for the Android app developed. Users can create an account, log-in, create tasks, complete tasks, and rate each other. We also have most of the code working for geotagging tasks (We still need to add the ability for longer, multi-part tasks to have multiple geotags). 
	      We also need to implement a method for the creator of a task to also say that a task has been completed. Currently, when a task runner finishes a task, there is no input from the creator as to if it has actually been completed.
		  We must also create the chat method so that users may chat with each other.</p>
	  <p> As you can tell by reading this, we have (slowly) begun development of the Garcon website and web app. Since the backend for the Android app and web app is pretty much the same, the main work for the web app is the frontend.</p>
	  <p> We intend to use this blog as a way to document our progress and explain certain design choices we make so that others trying to develop a similar app may have a point of reference.</p>
